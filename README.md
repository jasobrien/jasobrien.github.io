# Property Investment Calculator

A simple, browser-based calculator for analysing Australian property investment scenarios. The tool allows users to enter property details, financial assumptions, and mortgage parameters to automatically compute:

* Upfront purchase costs
* Mortgage repayment amounts
* Cashflow impacts
* Custom scenarios via adjustable interest rates and deposit sizes
* Export of results to PDF

This project is ideal for investors assessing the viability of residential property purchases.
